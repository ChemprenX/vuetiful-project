#### Scoffold Branch

The `Scaffold` branch is a copy of this projects initial setup, so it can be used as scaffolding for any new vue/Laravel 5.4 project. At this point the project has integrated:

- Gulp
- Browserify
- Vueify
- Semantic-ui
- Babel
- Hot-Reloading
- Laravel route setup for SPA
- Base component
- Vue Config

In part 4 vue-router will be setup and this will be the last part of the scaffolding.
